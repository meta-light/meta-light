# Claude AI Trading Skill

Real-time crypto social data in Claude. Track trending tokens, surface narratives, search mentions, and run market analysis without leaving the chat.

## What it does

- Pull trending tokens and contract addresses from Twitter/X and Telegram
- Search social mentions by ticker or keyword
- Get smart follower and engagement stats for any Twitter/X account
- Surface trending narratives and event summaries
- Run AI-powered market analysis, token breakdowns, and account reviews
- Generate ready-to-use integration code (TypeScript, Python, curl)

If you have an API key, Claude makes live calls and returns real data. Without one, it generates correct code snippets you can use in your own app.

## Install

1. Download `SKILL.md` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Start a conversation with Claude and attach the file
3. Ask Claude to use that skill
